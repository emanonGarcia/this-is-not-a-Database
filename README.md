#This is not a Database!
I repeat, this is not a Database. TIND is a simpler CLI program that allows for usique users to create logins, and store unique information about one's self. Usernames must be unique and a password must correspond to the aforementioned username. File contains a
user.py which constructs users and takes in pertinent user info
##Getting Started
When the script is run, data from an existing .csv containing user data is loaded. In order to login in the user must be known to the 'database' or the user is prompted to create the first user. After a successful login the user is free to create new users.
#Prerequisites
python3

###Installing
After downloading and unzipping, execute login.py from the local directory
